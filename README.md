## Description

We kick Blok Tech @CMDA off with a JavaScript Bootcamp before we start with Back-end, Front-end 2. This Bootcamp will refresh and build further on the knowledge acquired in _Internetstandaarden_, _Inleiding Programmeren_, and _Blok Web_. 

A strong foundation in JavaScript as a language will help you get up to speed with the other courses. This Bootcamp is a combined two week effort of Front-end 2 and Back-end. Project Tech will run alongside the Bootcamp. After this **one week Bootcamp** both courses will start each with their own curriculum.

This is a Bootcamp so there are a lot of (new) resources and concepts to understand. The more time you invest in the Bootcamp, the easier the other courses in blok tech will be. 

> CMD is a full-time bachelor so you are expected to spend around 5h a day on reading and exercises. It's ok if you can't keep up or you don't understand concepts immediately. We just ask you to spend the allocated time each day.

*   [Slack][slack] — General chatter and Q&A

## Goals

* Refresh your JavaScript knowledge from previous courses
