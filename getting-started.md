You’re allowed to stay anonymous online for this course by omitting sensitive
information, but a good looking GitHub profile can help you get an internship or job later.

## Repository

We would like you to have one 'repo' for the *JavaScript bootcamp*. This makes it easier for us to find your files and grade your assignments. You are going to hand in your exercises from this bootcamp trough GitHub.

* Create a repository called `js-bootcamp`
* Add the folders and files of the `template-repo` folder to your repository.
  * There are files for exercises, you will put your answers there.
  * There are `md` files for your summary where you can type notes after reading the articles, watching the videos or reading chapters of the book.
  
> The theory of the bootcamp is part of the exam for front-end 2. Don't forget to make notes! It's handy to start writing your own summaries in your repository from the start.
